    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Danny Ruchtie. I'm a Dutch designer, a creator focused on
      human-computer interaction and strive to make technology accessible and
      easier to use through user interface design. My favorite designs are the
      ones that don't just solve a problem, but also, engage you on an emotional
      level when there's that balance between functionality and emotion.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently helping the great CodeSandbox team to make web development
      more accessible. I have two decades of experience assisting organizations
      to grow and innovate through design. I'm a mission-driven designer &
      manager with experience building teams & products for startups and large
      organizations alike. Previously I lead the IBM Design studio Benelux
      before I became the Growth Platform Leader for IBM IX CIC Benelux.
    </p>

    <p>
      I helped the auction site Catawiki with the design of their mobile
      platform. Working for different agencies, I have previously led design
      teams and processes, designed products and user interfaces, and consulted
      for companies like: Shell, Samsung, Daimler, Heineken, Philips, The Dutch
      ministry of Defense and Albelli.
    </p>

    <p>
      When not designing, I'm probably having fun with my family or
      photographing the random beauty of everyday things. If you want to connect
      or follow me along, you can find me at{" "}
